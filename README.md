# dssim-scenario-controller

This is a implementation of the **DataSpace-Scenario-Controller** of the **D**ata**S**pace**SIM**ulation (DSSIM) Framework. It is the central orchestrator of the scenario execution. It provides basic methods and objects to control the scenario execution to the scenario description.

## The DSSIM-Framework

The DSSIM-Framework was initially created as part of a Master-Thesis. Here's the abstract:

_To promote digital ecosystems, various projects and initiatives are currently underway to establish data spaces for sovereign data exchange. Due to the diverse design options regarding architecture, technologies and processes, there is a need for technical support to facilitate experimentation in this context. This paper proposes a technical framework that enables the description, simulation, and evaluation of data space scenarios. Initially, goals are defined, fundamentals are described, and related work is analyzed. The main part provides a detailed description of the reference implementation of the framework. An evaluation based on a practical project demonstrates its suitability for the application area._
